## Hi! 👋 I'm Aaron.

I enjoy taking on solo and team projects spanning different disciplines of engineering, from custom e-bike drivetrains to reverse engineering my car!

I'm currently a senior at Burlingame High School in California and plan on attending MIT next year as part of the Class of 2025.

### My favorite projects

- 🚀 I designed [Zenith](https://github.com/aaroexxt/TVCRocket), a model rocket that (*ahem ahem tries to*) fly itself using thrust-vector control.
- 🖥️ I also wrote some [ground station software](https://github.com/aaroexxt/RocketGroundStation), for remote flight planning, monitoring, and control.
- 🛹 I'm working on a [custom electric skateboard and remote](https://github.com/aaroexxt/ESkateOS) to commute in style, in addition to an [electric bike](https://github.com/aaroexxt/BikeOSMKII)
- 🚗 I [hacked my Subaru](https://github.com/aaroexxt/CarHacking) to read data from the car's ECU (Engine Control Unit) in real-time
- 🗣 I [created a dataset](https://github.com/aaroexxt/tacotron) to train a neural network to synthesize my voice (the results are only mildly creepy)
- 🕹️ I made a video game [rendering engine](https://github.com/aaroexxt/ASCII-Physics-Engine) that outputs only ASCII characters, and then made a [working game](https://www.aaronbecker.tech/projects/code/platformedv5/) with it! ~~*Checkmate Kindle E-Reader gamers 😎*~~

### YouTube

🎥 I also occasionally post to a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqDrVuzqneQY3KwUUoAEITA) where I make videos about coding, engineering, music, and anything else that I'm interested in.
